**User**: ok restarted

**COO Response**: The chat router wasn't being included in main.py. Fixed! Now restart the backend and the endpoints should work.

**What was missing:**
- `routes/chat.py` had the endpoints but was never imported in `main.py`
- Added the import and `app.include_router(chat_router)`

Restart the backend and we can test memory extraction!
