**COO Response**: ## ✅ Updates Complete

The implementer has made both changes:

### 1. **Python Version** 
No changes needed - the code already uses `python3.8+` references which are compatible with Python 3.11. No hardcoded 3.12 references were found.

### 2. **Risk Limits Updated**
Changed daily risk limit from $20 (10%) to **$100 (50%)**:
