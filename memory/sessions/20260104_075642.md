**User**: what's my name?

**COO Response**: I don't have access to your personal information like your name. I can only see:

1. **Your working directory**: `/Users/jellingson/agent-swarm` - which suggests your username might be "jellingson"
2. **Git information** about the repository

If you'd like to tell me your name, I'm happy to use it! Otherwise, I can only infer from the filesystem path that your macOS username is likely "jellingson".
