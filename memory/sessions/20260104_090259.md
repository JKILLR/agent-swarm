**User**: what is my name

**COO Response**: I don't have access to personal information about you, such as your name. I can only see:

1. The current working directory (`/Users/jellingson/agent-swarm`)
2. Git configuration and repository information
3. Files you share with me during our conversation

Based on the file path, it appears your macOS username is **jellingson**, but I don't know your actual name unless you tell me.

Would you like to share your name, or is there something else I can help you with?
