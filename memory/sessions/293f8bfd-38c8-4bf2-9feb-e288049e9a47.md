# Session 293f8bfd-38c8-4bf2-9feb-e288049e9a47

**User**: tell what was done

**COO Response**: I see you've provided what appears to be a UUID/session ID. Could you clarify what you'd like me to do with this?

Some possibilities:
- Resume a previous agent task with this ID?
- Look up information related to this session?
- Use it for some other purpose?

Please let me know what action you need taken.
