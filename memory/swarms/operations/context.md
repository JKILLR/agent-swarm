# Operations Swarm Context

## Mission
Coordinate cross-swarm activities, manage resources, ensure quality across all departments. Act as the operational backbone that keeps all swarms running smoothly.

## Current Focus
- Track progress across all swarms
- Identify and resolve blockers
- Ensure consistent quality standards
- Facilitate communication between swarms

## Key Responsibilities
1. **Resource Allocation** - Ensure right swarm has right priority
2. **Quality Assurance** - Review deliverables before deployment
3. **Coordination** - Manage handoffs between swarms
4. **Documentation** - Keep organizational knowledge current
5. **Escalation** - Flag issues that need CEO attention

## Team
- **vp_operations** - Executive oversight of all operations
- **project_coordinator** - Tracks status, manages timelines
- **qa_agent** - Quality reviews, testing oversight

## Current State
Operations has been underutilized. Most work has flowed directly from COO to swarms. Need to establish:
- When Operations should be involved
- Standard operating procedures
- Quality gates for major changes

## Integration Points
- Receives status updates from all swarm orchestrators
- Reports roll-up status to COO
- Coordinates when work spans multiple swarms
- Manages the "how" while swarms focus on "what"

## Summary
Operations is the coordination layer between COO and swarms. Currently underutilized; needs clearer protocols for when to engage vs. direct delegation.
