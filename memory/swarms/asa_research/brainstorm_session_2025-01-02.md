# ASA Research Brainstorm Session - January 2, 2025

## New Testing Results & Strategic Questions

### Context
This document contains critical new testing results and conceptual questions that require team review and brainstorming. All ASA agents should review and discuss.

---

## Testing Results

[New sparsity measurements, convergence data, and performance metrics]

### Key Findings
- Updated sparsity measurements showing X% improvement
- Convergence patterns across different model sizes
- Performance benchmarks at scale

---

## Strategic Questions for Team Discussion

### 1. Architecture Fundamentals
- Current implementation: Attention with linguistically-derived sparsity mask
- Deeper vision: Predetermined embeddings, hyperbolic geometry, molecular dynamics
- **Question**: Is current approach a stepping stone or detour?

### 2. Predetermined Embeddings
- Concept: Fixed token positions based on semantic theory (like periodic table)
- No learning of embeddings - determined by linguistic properties
- **Question**: How would we construct a "semantic periodic table"?

### 3. Hyperbolic Geometry
- Language is hierarchical
- Hyperbolic space naturally encodes hierarchy
- **Question**: What are implementation challenges and benefits?

### 4. Molecular Dynamics Model
- Tokens as 3D objects with bonding sites
- Processing as relaxation, not attention computation
- **Question**: How would this change the computational model?

## Brainstorming Topics

### Topic 1: Validation of Current Results
- Are the 73.9% H6 correlation and 30.5% speedup results sufficient validation?
- What additional experiments would strengthen the case?

### Topic 2: Radical Architecture Exploration
- If we pursued predetermined embeddings, what would be the first prototype?
- What are the biggest risks and potential rewards?

### Topic 3: Path Forward Decision
- Continue current sparse attention approach to publication?
- Pivot to more radical architectural exploration?
- Run both paths in parallel?

## Action Items for Team

1. **Orchestrator**: Coordinate team discussion, synthesize findings
2. **Researcher**: Literature review on hyperbolic embeddings, molecular dynamics in NLP
3. **Implementer**: Assess technical feasibility of radical architecture
4. **Critic**: Challenge assumptions in both current and proposed approaches
5. **Benchmarker**: Define metrics for comparing architectural approaches

---

## Expected Deliverable

**Team Discussion Summary** including:
- Analysis of new testing results
- Evaluation of strategic questions
- Consensus or dissenting views on path forward
- Recommended next experiments or prototypes
- Timeline estimates for different approaches

**Deadline**: 72 hours for initial team discussion and summary
