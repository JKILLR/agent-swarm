# Seed Concepts & Ideas (from Notes)

## Problem Solving Engine (Jan 5, 2026)
Simple concept: Plug in problem + context → get solution/action

## Context Storage as Mind Map Graph (Jan 4, 2026)
- Idea for visual/graph-based context representation
- Potential connection to ASA's geometric semantics

## Key Insight: Meta MYND vs Consumer MYND
- **Meta MYND**: The R&D sandbox where J and Axel push boundaries
- **Consumer MYND**: The productized version for users
- Critical to keep these separate in development

## Local Model Integration (New)
Need: A local model that can:
1. **Ingest** raw data (notes, conversations, documents)
2. **Distill** into structured knowledge
3. **Synthesize** relevant context on-demand for any agent

This would create a persistent memory layer between raw data and Claude agents.
