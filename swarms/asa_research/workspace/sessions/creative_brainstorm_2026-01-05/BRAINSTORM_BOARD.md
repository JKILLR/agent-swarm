# ASA Creative Brainstorm Board

## The Challenge
How can ASA (Atomic Semantic Architecture) become something **genuinely novel** - not just another embedding system with fancy metaphors?

## Core ASA Concepts to Build On
- Concepts as "atoms" with inner shells (core meaning) and outer shells (context)
- Relationships as positions/distances in semantic space
- "Bonding" between concepts like chemistry
- The map IS the brain - structure reflects cognition

## What We're Looking For
- **Wild ideas** - physics-inspired, biology-inspired, anything
- **Novel representations** - beyond vectors and embeddings
- **Emergent properties** - what happens when concepts interact?
- **Differentiators** - what could ONLY ASA do?
