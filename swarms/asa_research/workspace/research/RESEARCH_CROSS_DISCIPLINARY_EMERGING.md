# Cross-Disciplinary and Emerging Paradigms Research for ASA
## Novel Connections and Critiques

**Date:** January 2, 2026
**Author:** Research Specialist
**Focus:** Cognitive neuroscience, philosophy of language, emerging paradigms, field critiques

---

## Executive Summary

This report explores UNCONVENTIONAL connections and CRITIQUES relevant to the Attributed Semantic Architecture (ASA) framework. The goal is to identify blind spots, emerging alternatives, and cross-disciplinary insights that could either strengthen or fundamentally challenge ASA's theoretical foundations.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Cognitive Neuroscience Challenge:** The brain does NOT appear to process semantics through discrete, predetermined constraint systems. Instead, distributed, context-sensitive, predictive processing dominates. This is a fundamental challenge to ASA's "periodic table" metaphor.

2. **Philosophical Critiques:** The compositionality assumption underlying formal semantics frameworks (Generative Lexicon, Lambek calculus) faces serious philosophical objections from inferentialism, contextualism, and embodied cognition paradigms.

3. **Emerging Paradigms:** Predictive processing, 4E cognition (embodied, embedded, enacted, extended), and construction grammar offer alternative frameworks that may supersede the structured approach ASA draws from.

4. **Strongest Critiques:** Critics argue that (a) semantic atoms do not exist, (b) meaning is radically contextual, (c) symbolic decomposition is incompatible with neural computation, and (d) cross-linguistic variation undermines universality claims.

**Recommendation:** ASA should explicitly acknowledge these critiques and position itself as a useful engineering approximation rather than claiming to capture the "true" structure of meaning.

## Part 1: Cognitive Neuroscience Perspectives on Semantic Constraints

### 1.1 How the Brain Processes Semantic Meaning

The fundamental question for ASA is: Does the brain encode semantic constraints in a way that resembles ASA's predetermined structure?

**What Neuroscience Reveals:**

#### 1.1.1 Distributed Semantic Representations

**Key Research:** Patterson, Nestor, & Rogers (2007) "Where do you know what you know?"

The brain does NOT have a "semantic periodic table" localized in a single region. Instead:

| Brain Region | Semantic Function | Evidence |
|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| Anterior Temporal Lobe (ATL) | Semantic hub - integrates features | Semantic dementia patients lose conceptual knowledge |
| Ventral Temporal Cortex | Category-specific representations | Animate/inanimate distinctions |
| Posterior Parietal | Action-related semantics | Damage impairs tool concepts |
| Prefrontal Cortex | Semantic control/selection | Context-dependent meaning access |
| Sensorimotor Cortices | Grounded features | Motor cortex active for action words |

**Implication for ASA:** There is no evidence for a discrete "type hierarchy" or "qualia structure" as distinct neural representations. Instead, concepts are patterns across distributed regions.

#### 1.1.2 The Hub-and-Spoke Model

**Key Research:** Lambon Ralph et al. (2017)

The dominant neuroscientific model of semantic memory is the "hub-and-spoke" model:

```
                     +--------+
                     |  ATL   |  <-- Transmodal semantic hub
                     |  HUB   |
                     +---+----+
                         |
    +--------+-----------+-----------+--------+
    |        |           |           |        |
+---v---+ +--v----+ +----v---+ +----v---+ +---v----+
| Motor | | Visual| | Auditory| |Olfactory| |Tactile |
| Spoke | | Spoke | | Spoke   | | Spoke   | | Spoke  |
+-------+ +-------+ +---------+ +---------+ +--------+
```

**Key Claims:**
- Concepts are grounded in modality-specific features (spokes)
- The ATL integrates these into coherent concepts (hub)
- There is NO discrete type hierarchy; similarity is graded

**Challenge to ASA:**
- ASA's Axis 5 (Geometric/hierarchical position) assumes discrete ontological categories
- Neuroscience suggests concepts are similarity clouds, not discrete types
- The "periodic table" metaphor implies chemical-like discrete elements, but neural semantics is continuous

#### 1.1.3 Predictive Processing and Semantic Expectation

**Key Research:** Federenko & Thompson-Schill (2014); Kuperberg (2016)

The brain processes language through PREDICTIVE processing, not constraint-checking:

1. **Top-down prediction:** Context generates expectations about upcoming words
2. **Prediction error:** Unexpected inputs generate larger neural responses (N400 effect)
3. **Constraint integration:** Multiple constraints are probabilistically combined

**Evidence:**
- N400 amplitude scales with predictability, not category membership
- Semantic priming shows gradual activation, not discrete selection
- Context can override literal meaning (metaphor comprehension)

**Implication for ASA:**
ASA models semantic constraints as binary (compatible/incompatible). The brain uses PROBABILISTIC, context-dependent constraint integration. This suggests:
- ASA's binary masks should be continuous scores
- Context should modulate constraint strength
- Prediction error, not constraint satisfaction, may be the core mechanism

### 1.2 Neural Evidence on Qualia-Like Representations

**Question:** Does the brain represent something like Pustejovsky's qualia structure?

#### 1.2.1 Telic/Agentive Knowledge in the Brain

**Key Research:** Martin (2016); Binder et al. (2016)

There is neural evidence for function-based vs. origin-based knowledge:

| Feature Type | Neural Correlate | Example |
|--------------|------------------|---------|
| Perceptual features (Formal/Constitutive) | Ventral temporal cortex | Color, shape |
| Functional features (Telic) | Posterior parietal, premotor | What it's used for |
| Motion features | MT/V5, posterior temporal | How it moves |
| Origin/creation (Agentive) | Less clear localization | How it came to be |

**Partial Support for Qualia:** The brain DOES distinguish perceptual vs. functional knowledge, which aligns with Formal/Constitutive vs. Telic qualia.

**Challenge:** The brain does NOT appear to have discrete "quale slots." Instead, features are distributed across sensory and motor systems.

#### 1.2.2 Coercion Processing in the Brain

**Key Research:** Pylkkanen & McElree (2007); Kuperberg et al. (2010)

Neuroimaging studies on complement coercion ("begin the book") show:

- **Increased processing cost:** Longer reading times, larger N400
- **Left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC):** Active during coercion
- **Left posterior temporal cortex:** Active for semantic retrieval

**Interpretation:**
- Coercion requires ADDITIONAL processing, not just feature lookup
- VLPFC suggests controlled semantic selection, not automatic quale access
- This is MORE compatible with ASA's attention-based coercion (Proposal C) than predetermined morphisms (Proposal A)

### 1.3 Force Dynamics in Neural Processing

**Key Research:** Wolff et al. (2010); Kemmerer (2015)

Is there neural evidence for Talmy's force dynamics?

**Evidence:**
- Causative verb comprehension activates motor-related regions
- Agonist/antagonist distinctions correlate with neural response patterns
- Force-dynamic language activates simulation networks

**But Also:**
- Force dynamics may be grounded in motor simulation, not abstract schema
- This suggests EMBODIED rather than SYMBOLIC representation
- Challenge: How can predetermined embeddings capture embodied simulation?

### 1.4 Summary: Neuroscience Insights for ASA

| ASA Assumption | Neuroscience Reality | Recommendation |
|----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Discrete type hierarchy | Continuous similarity space | Use soft boundaries, probabilistic types |
| Predetermined qualia structure | Distributed, context-dependent features | Treat qualia as biases, not fixed slots |
| Binary constraint satisfaction | Probabilistic, graded processing | Use continuous compatibility scores |
| Static semantic features | Dynamic, predictive processing | Integrate prediction error signals |
| Symbolic representation | Grounded in sensorimotor simulation | Consider embodied extensions |

## Part 2: Philosophical Critiques of Compositional Semantics

### 2.1 The Critique of Semantic Atoms

#### 2.1.1 Wittgenstein's Challenge to Semantic Primitives

**Core Argument:** Wittgenstein (1953) "Philosophical Investigations"

The NSM (Natural Semantic Metalanguage) primes assumed in ASA's theoretical foundation face a fundamental philosophical objection:

1. **Meaning is use:** Words do not have fixed meanings; meaning is determined by use in language games
2. **Family resemblance:** Categories like GAME have no common essence; members share overlapping similarities
3. **No private language:** Semantic primitives cannot be defined ostensively or introspectively

**Implication for ASA:** The 65 NSM primes may be useful heuristics, but they are NOT fundamental semantic atoms. Any decomposition into primes is one of many possible descriptions, not THE structure of meaning.

#### 2.1.2 Quine's Critique of Analyticity

**Core Argument:** Quine (1951) "Two Dogmas of Empiricism"

The distinction between analytic truths (true by meaning) and synthetic truths (true by fact) is indefensible. This undermines:

- **Selectional restrictions:** If "colorless green ideas" is anomalous, is this due to MEANING or BELIEF?
- **Type hierarchies:** If DOG <: ANIMAL, is this analytic or just highly confirmed?
- **Qualia structure:** If BOOK.telic = reading, is this definitional or conventional?

**Implication for ASA:** ASA's constraints may encode conventional associations, not semantic truth. The distinction between "semantic anomaly" and "pragmatic oddity" may be untenable.

### 2.2 The Critique of Compositionality

#### 2.2.1 The Context Principle Challenge

**Core Argument:** Contextualism (Travis 2008; Recanati 2010)

Radical contextualism holds that word meaning is RADICALLY context-dependent:

**Examples:**
- "The ham sandwich left without paying" (metonymy)
- "The city is asleep" (metaphor)
- "She opened the letter" (instrument unspecified)
- "The car needs washing" (agentless passive)

In each case, CONTEXT determines meaning. Compositionality fails because:
1. Literal meaning underdetermines sentence meaning
2. Context does not just SELECT a sense; it CREATES a contextual meaning
3. There is no stable "what is said" independent of context

**Implication for ASA:**
- Predetermined embeddings assume stable word meanings
- But if meaning is radically contextual, predetermined structure is wrong in principle
- ASA may need to be reframed as modeling CONVENTIONAL associations, not meaning

#### 2.2.2 The Productivity Problem

**Core Argument:** Fodor & Lepore (2002); Pagin & Westerstahl (2010)

Compositionality is supposed to explain PRODUCTIVITY (infinite meanings from finite primitives). But:

- Coercion, metonymy, metaphor all violate strict compositionality
- If composition rules must be supplemented with "repair" operations, the rules are not truly compositional
- Generative Lexicon's coercion mechanisms are ADDITIONAL to basic composition

**Implication for ASA:**
ASA's coercion mechanism (enriched categories, type-shifting) is an admission that strict compositionality fails. This is honest, but undermines the "periodic table" claim of discovering fundamental structure.

### 2.3 Inferentialism vs. Representationalism

#### 2.3.1 The Inferentialist Alternative

**Core Argument:** Brandom (1994) "Making It Explicit"

Meaning is NOT representation of world-word relations. Meaning is INFERENTIAL ROLE:

- To understand "dog" is to know what follows from something being a dog
- To understand "bachelor" is to know the inference to "unmarried"
- Meaning is normative: what you are ENTITLED and COMMITTED to

**Implication for ASA:**
- Qualia might be reinterpreted as inferential commitments
- BOOK.telic = reading means: if you use a book, you're committed to reading
- This SUPPORTS ASA's constraint approach but reinterprets what constraints ARE

#### 2.3.2 Dynamic Semantics Challenge

**Core Argument:** Heim (1982); Groenendijk & Stokhof (1991)

Meaning is not truth conditions but CONTEXT CHANGE POTENTIAL:

- "A man walked in" creates a discourse referent
- "He sat down" accesses that referent
- Meaning is a function from contexts to contexts

**Implication for ASA:**
- Static embeddings cannot capture discourse dynamics
- ASA may need dynamic component for anaphora, presupposition
- This is acknowledged in ROUND1_THEORY_EXPLORATION but not addressed

### 2.4 The Embodied Cognition Critique

#### 2.4.1 Grounded Cognition

**Core Argument:** Barsalou (2008); Glenberg & Kaschak (2002)

Meaning is GROUNDED in sensorimotor experience:

- Comprehending "grasp the cup" activates motor regions
- Abstract concepts are metaphorically grounded (TIME IS SPACE)
- Meaning is not amodal symbols but modal simulations

**Evidence:**
- Action-sentence compatibility effect
- Motor interference from irrelevant actions
- Faster processing when body position matches described action

**Challenge to ASA:**
- ASA assumes amodal symbolic representations
- Embodied cognition suggests meaning requires SIMULATION
- How can predetermined embeddings capture simulation?

#### 2.4.2 4E Cognition Framework

**Core Claims:** Newen, De Bruin, & Gallagher (2018)

Cognition is:
1. **Embodied:** Depends on bodily structure and action
2. **Embedded:** Scaffolded by environment
3. **Enacted:** Constituted by sensorimotor interaction
4. **Extended:** Includes external tools and representations

**Implication for ASA:**
- Meaning may not be "in the head" (or in embeddings)
- Semantic understanding may require interaction, not representation
- This fundamentally challenges the "static periodic table" vision

## Part 3: Emerging Paradigms (2023-2025)

### 3.1 Predictive Processing as Alternative to Constraint Satisfaction

#### 3.1.1 The Predictive Processing Framework

**Key Researchers:** Clark (2013); Hohwy (2013); Friston (2010)

Predictive processing (PP) / Active Inference offers an alternative to constraint-based semantics:

**Core Claims:**
1. The brain is a prediction machine
2. Perception is hypothesis testing
3. Action minimizes prediction error
4. Everything is Bayesian inference

**Language in PP:**
- Word meaning = predictions about upcoming context
- Composition = updating predictions
- Anomaly = prediction error (high surprisal)

**Comparison to ASA:**

| ASA Approach | Predictive Processing |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Constraint satisfaction | Prediction error minimization |
| Binary compatibility | Probabilistic expectation |
| Static predetermined structure | Dynamic, context-updating predictions |
| Bottom-up composition | Top-down prediction + bottom-up error |

#### 3.1.2 Free Energy Principle for Semantics

**Key Insight:** Meaning minimizes free energy (surprisal + complexity)

**Formalization:**
```
F = D_KL(Q(s) || P(s|o)) + log P(o)

Where:
- F = Free energy
- Q(s) = Posterior belief about semantic interpretation
- P(s|o) = True posterior given observations
- P(o) = Evidence (how expected is this utterance?)
```

**Implication for ASA:**
- ASA's constraints could be reinterpreted as PRIORS
- Predetermined structure = strong priors on semantic structure
- Attention masks = biasing prediction toward expected interpretations

### 3.2 Construction Grammar as Alternative to Compositional Semantics

#### 3.2.1 Core Claims of Construction Grammar

**Key Researchers:** Goldberg (1995, 2006); Croft (2001)

Construction Grammar (CxG) argues:

1. **Constructions are primitive:** Form-meaning pairings at ANY size (morpheme to sentence)
2. **No strict lexicon/grammar divide:** Constructions range from fully fixed to fully schematic
3. **No derivations:** Surface form directly encodes meaning
4. **Usage-based:** Constructions emerge from usage patterns

**Example:** The Ditransitive Construction

"She baked him a cake" = Ditransitive form + "transfer" meaning

The CONSTRUCTION contributes "transfer" meaning even though "bake" is not a transfer verb. This is NOT coercion; it's constructional meaning.

#### 3.2.2 Implications for ASA

| ASA Assumption | CxG Alternative |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Word-level constraints | Construction-level constraints |
| Composition from primitives | Constructions are unanalyzed units |
| Coercion is exceptional | Constructional coercion is basic |
| Predetermined word types | Usage-based, emergent patterns |

**Opportunity for ASA:**
- Add a CONSTRUCTION axis encoding constructional meaning
- Recognize that some "coercion" is actually constructional composition
- This aligns with existing work on construction-aware parsing

### 3.3 Large Language Models as Implicit Semantics

#### 3.3.1 The LLM Challenge to Formal Semantics

**Key Observation:** LLMs like GPT-4 exhibit sophisticated semantic behavior WITHOUT explicit semantic representation:

- Handle coercion, metaphor, metonymy
- Show sensitivity to selectional restrictions
- Generate contextually appropriate meanings
- Pass tests designed for formal semantic competence

**Question:** Does this undermine ASA's explicit semantic structure?

#### 3.3.2 Arguments FOR Continued ASA Development

1. **Interpretability:** LLMs are black boxes; ASA provides interpretable constraints
2. **Efficiency:** Predetermined constraints may enable sparser, more efficient processing
3. **Systematicity:** LLMs may lack true compositional generalization; ASA addresses this
4. **Hybrid potential:** ASA constraints could guide/improve LLM processing

#### 3.3.3 Arguments AGAINST ASA's Approach

1. **LLMs work without it:** If implicit learning suffices, why explicit structure?
2. **Scale:** LLMs handle vocabulary far beyond ASA's coverage
3. **Flexibility:** LLMs adapt to novel contexts; predetermined structure may be brittle
4. **Simplicity:** Adding complexity must show clear benefit

### 3.4 Recent Developments in Cognitive Semantics (2023-2025)

#### 3.4.1 Conceptual Engineering

**Key Researchers:** Cappelen (2018); Haslanger (2012)

Meaning is not DISCOVERED but ENGINEERED:
- We can and should revise concepts for moral/practical purposes
- Semantic categories are human constructions, not natural kinds
- The "correct" analysis of a concept depends on purposes

**Implication for ASA:**
- ASA's "semantic periodic table" is a constructed tool, not discovered reality
- Different purposes may justify different constraint systems
- Claims to "the" structure of meaning are unjustified

#### 3.4.2 Linguistic Relativity Revival

**Key Research:** Majid & Burenhult (2014); Evans & Levinson (2009)

Strong cross-linguistic variation challenges universality:

- Spatial relations vary dramatically across languages
- Some languages lack tense; others have evidentiality
- Color categories differ (Russian has two "blues")
- Kinship systems vary in which distinctions are lexicalized

**Challenge to ASA:**
- NSM primes may be English-biased
- VerbNet is English-only
- "Universal" constraints may not transfer cross-linguistically
- (This aligns with existing critique in STATE.md)

---

## Part 4: Strongest Critiques of ASA's Foundational Assumptions

### 4.1 Critique 1: Semantic Atoms Do Not Exist

**The Argument:**

1. NSM's 65 primes are PROPOSED, not discovered
2. Competing decompositions exist (e.g., Jackendoff, Wierzbicka, Schank)
3. No empirical method definitively identifies primitive concepts
4. Cross-cultural psychology suggests cognitive diversity

**Counter-argument for ASA:**
Even if primes are not literally atomic, they may be USEFUL ABSTRACTIONS for engineering purposes. The periodic table of chemistry also has an arbitrary division of "element" that has proven useful.

**Recommendation:**
- Avoid claiming primes are "fundamental"
- Acknowledge they are useful organizing principles
- Be open to alternative decompositions

### 4.2 Critique 2: Meaning is Radically Contextual

**The Argument:**

1. Word meaning is never context-free
2. Even "literal" meaning depends on background knowledge
3. Metaphor and metonymy are not exceptions but central
4. Static embeddings cannot capture dynamic meaning

**Counter-argument for ASA:**
- Predetermined structure + contextual modulation
- Core constraints constrain space; context selects within space
- Graded types allow contextual flexibility

**Recommendation:**
- Explicitly model context-dependence
- Treat predetermined structure as DEFAULT, not FIXED
- Add mechanisms for contextual override

### 4.3 Critique 3: Symbolic Decomposition is Neurally Implausible

**The Argument:**

1. Brain uses distributed, not localist, representations
2. No evidence for discrete semantic features
3. Similarity is graded, not categorical
4. Learning is continuous, not rule-based

**Counter-argument for ASA:**
- Predetermined structure is an ENGINEERING choice, not claim about brain
- Hybrid symbolic-neural systems can work (neurosymbolic AI)
- Constraints can be implemented as soft biases, not hard rules

**Recommendation:**
- Distinguish engineering claims from cognitive claims
- Implement constraints as continuous scores, not binary masks
- Connect to neurosymbolic literature explicitly

### 4.4 Critique 4: Cross-Linguistic Variation Undermines Universality

**The Argument:**

1. VerbNet is English-only
2. Thematic roles vary across languages
3. Grammatical categories differ (no clear noun/verb distinction in some languages)
4. Semantic fields are partitioned differently

**Counter-argument for ASA:**
- Universals exist at ABSTRACT level (all languages have agents, patients)
- Variation is in REALIZATION, not underlying structure
- Multilingual resources exist (Universal PropBank, UCCA)

**Recommendation:**
- Begin with English but plan for multilingual extension
- Test claims empirically on typologically diverse languages
- Acknowledge English bias in current implementation

### 4.5 Critique 5: The Periodic Table Analogy is Misleading

**The Argument:**

1. Chemical elements are DISCOVERED natural kinds
2. The periodic table PREDICTS undiscovered elements
3. Electron configuration DETERMINES bonding
4. None of this applies to language

**Comparison:**

| Chemistry | Language |
|-----------|----------|
| 118 elements | 100,000+ words |
| Fixed properties | Context-dependent meaning |
| Predicts unknowns | Does not predict new meanings |
| Physical necessity | Social convention |
| Universal | Cross-linguistic variation |

**Recommendation:**
- Drop "periodic table" framing in academic contexts
- Use more modest metaphor: "semantic coordinate system" or "constraint lattice"
- Acknowledge the disanalogy explicitly

---

## Part 5: Opportunities and Alternative Framings

### 5.1 Reframing ASA as Engineering, Not Discovery

**Proposal:** ASA provides USEFUL CONSTRAINTS for computational semantics, not THE structure of meaning.

**Benefits:**
- Avoids philosophical objections to foundationalism
- Acknowledges constructed nature of categories
- Allows pragmatic evaluation (does it help?)
- Honest about epistemic status

**New Framing:**
> "ASA provides a principled ENGINEERING framework for semantic attention constraints, drawing on insights from multiple linguistic traditions. We do not claim these constraints reflect the true structure of meaning, but that they improve model performance and interpretability."

### 5.2 Integrating Predictive Processing

**Proposal:** Reinterpret ASA constraints as PRIORS in a predictive processing framework.

**Implementation:**
1. Predetermined constraints = prior probability distributions
2. Context = likelihood function
3. Attention weights = posterior expectation
4. Coercion = belief updating under conflict

**Advantages:**
- Connects to dominant cognitive science paradigm
- Natural handling of context-dependence
- Graded, probabilistic processing
- Error-driven learning

### 5.3 Embracing Construction Grammar

**Proposal:** Extend ASA to CONSTRUCTION-level constraints.

**Implementation:**
1. Add construction axis: {transitive, ditransitive, resultative, ...}
2. Constructions carry meaning independent of words
3. Word-construction compatibility as additional constraint
4. Construction coercion when words adapt to constructions

**Advantages:**
- Handles constructional meaning
- Explains "unexpected" coercion
- Aligns with usage-based linguistics
- More comprehensive coverage

### 5.4 Acknowledging Embodied Grounding

**Proposal:** Add embodied features to ASA representations.

**Implementation:**
1. Motor features for action concepts
2. Perceptual features for concrete nouns
3. Embodied metaphor mappings for abstract concepts
4. Simulation-based processing for force dynamics

**Challenges:**
- Requires multimodal embeddings
- May conflict with language-only models
- Harder to implement with text data

**Partial Solution:** Use language-based approximations to embodied features (distributional proxies for perceptual/motor information).
