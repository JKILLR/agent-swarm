## Core Strategy

### The Arbitrage Mechanism

1. **Binary Market Structure**: Each BTC 15-minute market has two tokens:
   - UP token: Pays $1.00 if BTC goes up
   - DOWN token: Pays $1.00 if BTC goes down

2. **Guaranteed Profit**: If UP_price + DOWN_price < $1.00, buying both guarantees profit:
   - Example: UP @ $0.48 + DOWN @ $0.48 = $0.96 cost
   - Payout: $1.00 (one side always wins)
   - Profit: $0.04 per share pair (4.17% return)

3. **Market Rollover**: New markets open every 15 minutes, providing continuous opportunities.

## Priority 0 (P0) - Critical Fixes for Safety and Profitability

### P0-1: Use Best Ask Instead of Midpoint (IMPLEMENTED)
**Status**: Already Fixed

The bot correctly uses the order book /book endpoint to get actual executable prices via best_ask rather than the /midpoint endpoint which returns theoretical prices that may not be available.

### P0-2: Private Key Security (IMPLEMENTED)
**Status**: Already Fixed

Private keys are loaded from environment variables via os.getenv("POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY") in config.py.

### P0-3: Slippage Buffer (IMPLEMENTED)
**Status**: Already Fixed

A 0.5% slippage buffer is applied to cost calculations in check_arbitrage().

### P0-4: Daily Loss Limit (IMPLEMENTED 2026-01-04)
**Status**: Implemented

Added can_trade() method that checks:
- Daily P&L against max_daily_risk setting (default: $20)
- Automatically resets at midnight
- Prevents trading when daily loss limit exceeded

### P0-5: Liquidity Validation (IMPLEMENTED 2026-01-04)
**Status**: Implemented

Added minimum liquidity check in check_arbitrage():
- Requires minimum $100 notional value at best ask
- Calculated as: best_ask_price * available_size >= $100
- Skips markets with thin liquidity to avoid slippage
